- **Week-4,5**: Learn about Pairs Trading and Index Trading and develop more trading strategies.

## Key Concepts

### Python Programming Fundamentals
Learning about Python fundamentals and its libraries like numpy, mathplotlib

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP Concepts: I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.<br>
Hands-on OOP: I explored OOP through both structured tutorials and a mini-project (MicroGrad), which deepened my understanding by applying OOP to a machine learning context.

### Financial Markets & Quantitative Trading
Market Structure: I studied the different players in the market, how trading terminals work, and the flow of orders (bid, ask, order book).<br>
Market Jargon: I became familiar with essential trading terms such as swing, pullback, volatility, volume, and liquidity.<br>
Technical & Fundamental Analysis: I learned about analyzing stocks using both technical indicators (like RSI, MACD, moving averages) and fundamental analysis.<br>
Events & Impact: I understood how major events can impact markets and influence trading decisions.<br>
Algorithmic Trading: I discovered why algorithmic trading is popular, its advantages (speed, precision, emotionless execution), and its limitations (black swan events, technological and regulatory constraints).<br>
Trading Environment: I practiced developing and testing trading algorithms in a simulated environment, learning about concepts like execution time, transaction costs, partial order filling, and position limits.<br>

### Strategy Development & Backtesting
Strategy Implementation: I designed and implemented trading strategies, such as breakout strategies using rolling price channels, and evaluated their performance.<br>
Backtesting: I learned the importance of backtesting strategies on historical data to avoid overfitting and to assess real-world viability.<br>
Risk Management: I explored risk management techniques, such as ATR-based position sizing, to control exposure and manage drawdowns.<br>

### Pair Trading
Pairs trading involves trading the price relationship between two correlated assets.Apply pairs trading if Luxray, Jolteon, and Shinx often move together, but sometimes drift apart in price.

### Index Trading
Index trading means trading a basket of assets (an index) rather than individual ones. It offers diversification and reduces the risk of single-product volatility. Indexes in this assignment were:
Ash Index: 6 Luxrays, 3 Jolteons, 1 Shinx
Misty Index: 4 Luxrays, 2 Jolteons
