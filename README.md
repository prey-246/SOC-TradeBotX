## Python Programming Fundamentals
Learning about Python fundamentals and its libraries like numpy, mathplotlib

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP Concepts: I learned the basics of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, methods, and inheritance.
Hands-on OOP: I explored OOP through both structured tutorials and a mini-project (MicroGrad), which deepened my understanding by applying OOP to a machine learning context.

## Financial Markets & Quantitative Trading
Market Structure: I studied the different players in the market, how trading terminals work, and the flow of orders (bid, ask, order book).
Market Jargon: I became familiar with essential trading terms such as swing, pullback, volatility, volume, and liquidity.
Technical & Fundamental Analysis: I learned about analyzing stocks using both technical indicators (like RSI, MACD, moving averages) and fundamental analysis.
Events & Impact: I understood how major events can impact markets and influence trading decisions.
Algorithmic Trading: I discovered why algorithmic trading is popular, its advantages (speed, precision, emotionless execution), and its limitations (black swan events, technological and regulatory constraints).
Trading Environment: I practiced developing and testing trading algorithms in a simulated environment, learning about concepts like execution time, transaction costs, partial order filling, and position limits.

## Strategy Development & Backtesting
Strategy Implementation: I designed and implemented trading strategies, such as breakout strategies using rolling price channels, and evaluated their performance.
Backtesting: I learned the importance of backtesting strategies on historical data to avoid overfitting and to assess real-world viability.
Risk Management: I explored risk management techniques, such as ATR-based position sizing, to control exposure and manage drawdowns.
